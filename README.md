A quick-start CMake template for those wishing to statically link their project with SDL2 on Windows.<br>
Static libraries for SDL2 still need to be built, to do this (if you haven't already), 
clone the SDL2 repo and follow the instructions in SDL/docs/README-cmake.md .
You'll also need the Windows 10 / Windows 11 SDK.
